Hey there!

I am Fabian, a 20-year-old Computer Science student from Hamburg, Germany. I like reading, coding, music, and running, and I will try to post stuff that I find interesting or helpful to others. In the meanwhile, if you want to tell me anything, please do so on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fceschmidt).

This blog uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with the [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme.

Thanks for reading!
