I decided by now that I want to spend some time in my life reading books, the old-fashioned way. I have read books in the past, mostly books for adolescents, not to mention a bunch of fantasy and some science-fiction novels, but I only recently discovered that my score on most *Top 100 books* lists I can find on the omniscient Internet is below five. A limiting factor might be that my native language is not English, but that aside, I have four languages to care about, and I don't get more than ten out of a hundred anywhere else either.

So I said to myself, well, if there are so many books out there which are supposed to be more interesting than most stuff I've read so far -- and I have always enjoyed reading books -- starting one of those lists, one book by one, will probably be a lot of fun.

This week I decided to start with the ['ultimate list,'](public/assets/20161102-booklist-en.pdf) a list compiled by *Medium* author Joel Patrick. Three of the books mentioned there I have already completed:

* George Orwell, *1984* (13)
* Aldous Huxley, *Brave New World* (18)
* Douglas Adams, *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* (46)

Therefore, the first book I will read is F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby*, and I will let you know what I think about it when I'm done.
